# Deploy-Test Checklist

This is the comprehensive checklist of items to verify after `docker compose up -d --build` on a **Linux/Docker host**. The Go code was developed and unit-tested on Windows (where the Linux runtime can't run), so these are the runtime integration checks.

## 0. Build + boot

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f claude   # watch for [server] listening on :8080
```

- [ ] Container starts without crash; log shows `listening on :8080`.
- [ ] `curl localhost:8080/health` → `{"ok":true}`.
- [ ] `curl -X POST localhost:8080/auth -d '{"username":"<BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USER>","password":"<BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD>"}' -H 'content-type: application/json'` → 200 + `Set-Cookie: session=...`.

## 1. Web UI

- [ ] Open `http://localhost:8080` → login page (Claude style, warm palette).
- [ ] Sign in with bootstrap admin → prompted to change password.
- [ ] Change password → app loads (left sidebar, Terminal active).
- [ ] Toggle theme (light/dark/system) — persists on reload.
- [ ] Resize to mobile width → sidebar becomes a drawer (≡ button).

## 2. Admin user management

- [ ] Sidebar → Users → "+ New user" → create `alice` (role: user, password).
- [ ] alice appears in the table with disk/traffic/sessions columns.
- [ ] Sign out → sign in as alice → password-change prompt (first login).
- [ ] Suspend alice (admin) → alice's cookie stops working immediately.

## 3. Per-user terminal

- [ ] As alice, open Terminal → shell starts (runs as `alice` via gosu, not root).
- [ ] Type `whoami` → `alice`. Type `id` → uid matches the allocated uid (2000+).
- [ ] Type `claude` → claude runs (if credential preset is bound).
- [ ] "+ New session" → second tab. Switch between sessions.
- [ ] Close browser → reopen → sessions resume (detach/attach works).

## 4. Credential injection

- [ ] Admin → Credentials → "+ New preset" → enter an Anthropic token.
- [ ] Create user `bob` with the preset bound.
- [ ] As bob, in terminal → `echo $ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` shows the decrypted value.
- [ ] Admin → Credentials list does NOT show the token value (only name/note).

## 5. Web file manager

- [ ] As alice, open **Files** → browse `/workspace` contents.
- [ ] Upload a small file in Files; confirm it appears in `/home/alice/workspace` when viewed in terminal (`ls`).
- [ ] Download the uploaded file and confirm bytes match.
- [ ] Edit file text inline and save; verify updated content persisted.
- [ ] Delete the file via Files → it disappears from terminal listing.
- [ ] Attempt path escape with input like `../../etc` while browsing/uploading; request returns HTTP `400`.
- [ ] Upload + download traffic is reflected in monthly usage at `/api/admin/users/:id/usage` (`↑`/`↓` byte counters increase for alice).

## 6. Quotas

- [ ] Admin → Users → alice's disk column shows used/limit.
- [ ] Upload a large file via Files/web upload → disk usage updates within 60s.
- [ ] Over-quota → panel shows "over" + terminal shows a warning banner.

## 7. Traffic

- [ ] After some claude/web-file-manager activity → admin → Users → traffic column shows ↓/↑ bytes.
- [ ] Monthly traffic table (`/api/admin/traffic`) shows the current month's totals.
- [ ] If `nft` is unavailable → log shows "traffic accounting in no-op mode" (graceful).

## 8. Terminal WS

- [ ] With Cloudflare + nginx + HTTPS in front, open terminal and keep it open >100s (no keyboard/app activity).
- [ ] Confirm WS remains connected beyond idle timeout; terminal still receives ping/pong packets.
- [ ] Simulate network interruption; terminal reconnects automatically and resumes session without data loss.
- [ ] Validate WS upgrade uses the auth cookie (HTTP 101 and no intermediate `401` during upgrade).

## 9. Claude login

- [ ] Confirm `/home/<user>/.claude` is a symlink to `/data/<user>/claude-config`.
- [ ] As alice in web terminal, run `claude login` and complete OAuth in a local browser.
- [ ] Verify `/data/<user>/claude-config/.credentials.json` is created and contains `claude ai` OAuth creds.

## 10. Capture (admin debug)

- [ ] Admin → Captures panel loads (empty initially).
- [ ] Enable capture on an admin session (API: `POST /api/admin/sessions/:id/capture/enable`).
- [ ] Run a claude API call → redacted req/resp appears in the Captures panel.
- [ ] Verify secrets are redacted (API keys show `[REDACTED]`).
- [ ] Disable capture → session restarts without the proxy.

## 11. Suspend / delete

- [ ] Suspend a user → their web login blocked and sessions die.
- [ ] Unsuspend → user can log in again.
- [ ] Delete a user → `/home/<user>` + `/data/<user>` removed, DB row gone.

## 12. Shell toolchain

After `docker compose up`, exec into the container as a regular user and confirm
all preinstalled tools resolve on the user PATH:

```bash
docker compose exec claude gosu alice bash -lc 'node -v && npm -v && python3 --version && git --version && claude --version'
```

Each command must print a version (node 22.x, npm 10.x, python 3.11.x, git 2.x,
claude x.y.z). A `command not found` means the image layer failed.

## 13. Network exposure (audit IP trust)

`clientIP` trusts `CF-Connecting-IP` / `X-Forwarded-For`. This is safe ONLY if
the container's 8080 port is not reachable directly from the public internet
(i.e. only nginx reaches it). If 8080 were public, a client could forge the
header. Verify: `docker compose port claude 8080` is bound to a private
interface / localhost, not 0.0.0.0:8080 exposed to the WAN.

## 14. Audit (login IP + session IP)

- As admin, open the **Audit** sidebar item: login events appear newest-first;
  a failed login (wrong password) shows as a red `fail` row with the attempted
  username and the client IP.
- Log in as a user via Cloudflare; the Audit row's IP is the user's real IP
  (not nginx's). If it shows a private/nginx IP, the `CF-Connecting-IP` /
  `X-Forwarded-For` header is not being passed by nginx.
- Users page: each user shows a `Last login` column with timestamp + IP.
- Create a terminal session for a user; as admin, the user's session list
  (`/api/admin/users/:id/sessions`) includes `clientIp` matching the login IP.

## Known gaps (documented)

These are Linux-runtime wiring items that compile + cross-compile clean but couldn't be runtime-verified on the Windows dev host. If something doesn't work, check here first:

- **cgroup apply + pid**: the cgroup subgroup is created but the PTY's pid may not be moved into `cgroup.procs` — CPU/mem limits may not enforce. Verify + fix if needed.
- **nft counter install**: counters are installed lazily on first session-create; verify the nft ruleset shows per-user rules.
- **Capture Response hook**: the go-mitmproxy `Response` callback (session resolution + redaction + store.Add) may need the flow's connection context wired to resolve the session id.
